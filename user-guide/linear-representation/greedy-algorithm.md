# Greedy Algorithm

To understand what you see in the Greedy Representation, you must see [breakpoint-algorithm.md](breakpoint-algorithm.md "mention").

Greedy Representation is exactly the same as the Breakpoint's, except that the user cannot interact with the sequence.

User only watches as the algorithm make revearsals.

The breakpoints choices is made based on Greedy Algorithm.
