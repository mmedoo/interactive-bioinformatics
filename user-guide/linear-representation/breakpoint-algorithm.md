# Breakpoint Algorithm

After you clicked on `Breakpoint` , you will see:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2025-05-24 02-26-11.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

As shown above, the sequence has 2 more elements on the beginning and on the end.

These are dummy blocks to make clear if the original sequence has any breakpoints on each of its ends.

On the bottom left, you will see the number of breakpoints in this sequence.

On the bottom right, a list of all revearsals conducted so far.

Now, the user can choose any 2 breakpoints, to apply the reveasal on the block in between.

After choosing 2 breakpoints, you will see:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/2025-05-2402-29-32-ezgif.com-crop-video (1).gif" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Here, chosen breakpoints are in blue. Revearsal is applied to the block in between.

Then, the step is added to the list.

You can choose any 2 breakpoints till the sequence has none.

And that was the Breakpoint representation.
