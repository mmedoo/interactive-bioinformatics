# Introduction

## &#x20;**Overview**

This project aims to simplify complex **bioinformatics algorithms** by visually representing them using the **Manim** (Mathematical Animation Engine) library. The animations help learners and researchers understand the behavior and logic of algorithms step by step through dynamic, intuitive visuals.

***

## &#x20;**Goals**

* Enhance conceptual understanding of bioinformatics algorithms.
* Deliver visually engaging educational content.
* Support researchers in visually presenting their work.

***

## &#x20;**Target Audience**

* Students studying computer science or computational biology.
* Researchers in bioinformatics.
* Developers working on educational or visualization tools.
